# mx-yn15-1

YT - M N 15 3 hr

1. Work from YT is being done here.

# Tools

1. Will try to use supabase as the postgres database DB Backed.
2. For authentication, using kinde from the tutorial.
3. You are deploying using the verce cli, which is better since every commit is not built and deployed. This is much better , that pushing a commit and being build every time. Writing this sentence to test if the commit is being picked up.
